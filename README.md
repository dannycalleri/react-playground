# React Fun

React app made for fun.

## Install

It's a simple CRA app, so:

- install: `npm install`
- start: `npm start`
- test: `npm test`

## Assumptions

- The implementation is in-memory: state is maintained at root level, navigating with browser history (browser back/forward buttons) works, hard refresh wipes app content
- I'm not using Redux or any other state management library because I thought it was overkill. I used a `useReducer` hook at the top level where I have the majority of the logic for updating state

## Known Issues/Todo(s)

- [ ] when editing a user, clicking on `new friend` once and then again on the appearing window, won't list the original edited users between friends available to select (it's fine on the first window since I wanted to treat the relationship as implicit)
- [ ] review variable names (e.g.: `openNewFriendWindow` in `UserForm.tsx`)
- [ ] test error cases for `UserForm` (test that all exceptions generated by the `saveFunction` have an effect on the UI)
- [ ] write better tests for `UserFormManager`
- [ ] show message to user on save/update
